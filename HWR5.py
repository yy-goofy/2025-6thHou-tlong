#1. Fix the "class" comment at the top to "6th Hour"
print("6th Hour")
#2. Create a list of the names of all the students in the classroom.
name_list = ["Connor", "Devon", "Alaya", "Shane", "Ally", "Tristan", "Ethan", "Greg",]
#3. Create a for loop that prints the names of every student in the list.
for name in name_list:
    print(name)
#4. Using the "in" operator (hint: Google), create a for loop that only prints
#the name of a student if the letter "e" is in it.
for name in name_list:
    if 'e' in name:
        print(name)
